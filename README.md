# Banking App
# Class Based

This was my second attempt at this project. My first attempt got a little messy.
I had also forgotten about try, except, which caused some issues as you can probably imagine.

Added a fun twist to __init__ which reads the transaction.txt file, and sets the balance
as the last recorded balance in the transaction file. got a nice hit of dopamine when that worked xD
